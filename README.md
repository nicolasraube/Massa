# Massa - Mobile Accessible Social Sharing Agent
This app allows users to split a large file ( or a torrent ) and separately download each block in different devices and combine them back to create the original files locally.

## Use Cases
1) A person can use multiple internet connections and multiple devices to download a file faster.
2) Multiple people with low bandwidth (low data packages) can download a larger file that is useful to all of them.

Imagine a university full of students all wanting a copy of latest Fedora DVD. They may not all have a fast connection to the internet or enough data available. One may get it from one who already downloaded it. One may download it using some extra data purchased from their ISP. Massa saves you these multiple downloads and wasted money and data.
